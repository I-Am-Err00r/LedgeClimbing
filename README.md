# Ledge Climbing
For a tutorial video on how these scripts work, visit my video: https://youtu.be/88NEMnzxwBs

This script does not require you follow any previous videos I have uploaded or any other scripts I have included; follow the instructions within the script
on how to use this as your own standalone solution with pseudocode.

Scripts have been updated with comments and might have some more optimal logic not discussed in video; these changes are minimal, but because YouTube doesn't allow to upload videos again after submitting, I can't make sure the video matches this script more exactly. The main difference is a bool that ensure the coroutine to climb the ledge only happens once and removes the part where I negate animationTime by .3 because the bool mentioned fixes this issue; so if watching the video and confused why that logic is added and missing, this is why.
